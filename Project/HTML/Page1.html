          The Black Dagger Brotherhood is an ongoing series of paranormal romance books by author J. R. Ward.<br>
          The series focuses on a society of vampire warriors who live together and defend their race against de-souled humans called lessers.<br>
          They are an elite force of military-grade vampires, bred for protecting their race, bonded into brotherhood by hundreds of years of devotion to their King and one another, but each having their own unique story, traits, and abilities.
          In terms of tropes, it has the standard vampire-slayer conflict, except that the world-building around that trope is wildly unexpected. In this world, vampires are a species distinct from humans that are born, not sired.
          Their progenitor is an immortal being known as the Scribe Virgin who is at war with another immortal known as the Omega and is determined to put an end to the vampire race.
          Furthermore, vampires donâ€™t kill or feed on humans; only the blood of their own race can nourish them.

          The "Brotherhood" phenomena started with the publishing of Dark Lover in 2005, and like a wildfire, grew to epic proportions within a very short amount of time into a USA Today Bestseller and a New York Times Bestseller hit series.
