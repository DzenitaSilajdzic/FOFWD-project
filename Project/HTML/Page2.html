          J.R. Ward is the author of over thirty novels, including those in her #1 New York Times and USA Today bestselling series, The Black Dagger Brotherhood.
          There are more than 15 million copies of Wardâ€™s novels in print worldwide and they have been published in 25 different countries around the world.<br><br>
          After graduating from law school, Ward began working in healthcare in Boston and spent many years as Chief of Staff of one of the premier academic medical centers in the nation.
          She lives in the south with her incredibly supportive husband and her beloved golden retriever.
          Writing has always been her passion and her idea of heaven is a whole day of nothing but her computer, her dog and her coffee pot.
