          There are more than 15 million copies of Wardâ€™s novels in print worldwide and they have been published in 25 different countries around the world.<br><br>
          After graduating from law school, Ward began working in healthcare in Boston and spent many years as Chief of Staff of one of the premier academic medical centers in the nation.
          She lives in the south with her incredibly supportive husband and her beloved golden retriever.
